# Syracuse University Course Project 
During my second semester at Syracuse University, I attended the course IST 256 from the School of Information Studies, focusing on Application Programs for Information Systems which in this course used Python and Jupyter Notebook.
For the end-of-the-year python project, students were tasked to produce a novel program in Jupyter Notebook utilizing programming skills demonstrated since the beginning of the semester. 
Requirements for this project included novelty, extensive lines of code (around 300 lines), coding techniques such as APIs, functions, for loops, widgets, and more to create a program that had purpose and functionality. This project was broken into 4 parts which included, brainstorming, planning/testing, implementation, and presentation, which aided in a smoother creation process that allowed for feedback and assistance along the way. As students we were encouraged to log changes and updates to our code, and to research and ask peers for assistance before attending office hours that were accessible and easily scheduled. This practice encouraged students to deepen our problem-solving skills while continuing to provide support when needed.

## KPOP Search Engine
To emphasize the skills I learned with Python and Jupyter Notebook I decided to create a program on a subject I was interested in: Music. To add more novelty I narrowed my focus to Korean Pop and Korean Pop fans as the niche and target of this project.
